## CV layout

The layout of the CV should be right for the role you're applying for. An accountant's CV should be boring, and a creative's CV can be more visually appealing. For your CV, the content is king. Layout and eye-appeal is secondary and in many cases can detract from the content.
Your CV should be a single column. 2-column CVs should be avoided. Applicant Tracking Systems often mess up column formatting, making your CV unreadable.
