If you're interested in moving into Data Science, Machine Learning, or AI, you need to be on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn). It's a hugely valuable community platform run by Google, with free short courses, public datasets, and open competitions.

Kaggle is just one part of [Google's AI Education programme](https://ai.google/build?featured=build_with_gemini&tagid=p-gemini). There are plenty more resources on [ai google](https://ai.google/).
