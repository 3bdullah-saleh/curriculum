## Creating your portfolio site

A Personal Website allows you to showcase your projects and skills in a personal and attractive way! It is also a fun project that keeps you practicing your skills and lets you demonstrate your creativity.

When making a personal website approach it as if it were a final project - practice all your skills and do sprints to deliver updates. Remember- you can continue to add features and iterate once it's live so it will continue to improve as you do!

Check the portfolio coursework to get started

Don't use stock websites or templates - this is a demonstration of your skills not someone else's!

Remember that you should be demonstrating the skills you'll be using in your job. Focus on adding the most in-demand features and stacks first.
