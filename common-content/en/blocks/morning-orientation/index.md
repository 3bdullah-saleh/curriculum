# üë£ Steps

0. Assemble the entire group (all volunteers & all trainees) in a circle
1. Choose someone (volunteer or trainee) to be a **facilitator** for this morning orientation block
2. The **facilitator** should briefly welcome everyone with an announcement. Here is an example announcement to read aloud:

> üí¨ "Morning everyone, Welcome to CYF {REGION}, this week we are working on {MODULE HERE} {SPRINT NUMBER HERE} and we're currently working on {SUMMARISE THE TOPICS OF THE WEEK}"

4. Check if there are any new volunteers or if there are some attendees who haven't met before. Ask any newcomers to introduce themselves to the group/relevant people

5. Go through the _morning day plan only_ (typically on the curriculum website) - check the following things:

- Check the number of Tech-Ed / PD volunteers you have for the morning
- Double-check check someone is leading a given session
- For any new activities ( like workshops or anything unfamiliar) - describe how this block works for the group. If there are any new volunteers, then briefly describe how that block works
- Decide how best to allocate trainees and volunteers for a given block - some blocks will make this clear

5. Nominate a timekeeper from the group - aim for someone who hasn't done it before.

‚è±Ô∏è Timekeepers will need to:

- Announce the start of an activity and how long it will take (check everyone is listening)
- Manage any whole class timers that are used in an activity
- Give people a 10-minute wrap-up warning before the end of an activity
- Announce the end of an activity and what happens next
