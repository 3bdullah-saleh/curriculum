It is essential to continually check-in with yourself and evaluate your progress as you move through the course.

One of the best ways of checking your progress against your past self is to go back to and tackle a problem from a previous part of the course.

{{<note title="Pair up and check progress" type="activity">}}

## Activity

1. Trainees need to split up into pairs
1. In your pairs, nominate a driver and a navigator. A driver will type out the code. A navigator will use the prep to steer you in your solution.
1. Go back to JS1 Week 4 prep and familiarise yourself with the problem/function in that week
1. Using the prep as a guide and reference, test and implement the function defined in JS1 Week 4

## Pay attention ❗🔍

- Ensure you write tests first and frequently run your tests your feedback
- Swap driver and navigator roles often - perhaps after every test
- Use the tests to break the problem - don't try implementing everything all at once
