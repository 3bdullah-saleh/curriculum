It is essential to continually check-in with yourself and evaluate your progress as you move through the course.

One of the best ways of checking your progress against your past self is to go back to and tackle a problem from 4 weeks ago.

{{<note title="Pair up and check progress" type="activity">}}

## Activity

1. Pair up with someone in your class
1. In your pairs, nominate a driver and a navigator. A driver will type out code. A navigator will use the prep to steer you in your solution.
1. Go back to JS1 Week 4 prep and familiarise yourself with the problem/function in that week
1. With the help of the prep, test and implement the function defined in JS1 Week 4

Do it without looking at the answer and using any other AI tool.
