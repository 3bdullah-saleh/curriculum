The rest of this module is split into three sprints, which you can complete in your own time: **self educate**, **self coordinate** and **self evaluate**. Each sprint concerns itself with the question of how the curriculum can be used to achieve each of these community goals. For each sprint, you'll need to start with the **prep** sprint to introduce yourself to new concepts before using the **backlog** to understand how you can start engaging with the community. For each sprint, there is a **success** page that defines the educational outcomes for each sprint.

        prep2[prep] --> backlog2[backlog] --> success2[success]
    end
        subgraph self evaluate
        direction TB
        prep3[prep] --> backlog3[backlog] --> success3[success]
    end
```

Ready, head to the [self educate sprint](../sprints/self-educate)
