During the course, you'll need to continually evaluate your progress against the course's **learning objectives**. For each sprint, you will have a **success** view that lists all the learning objectives for any blocks in the prep and workshops. It serves as an overview of your learning outcomes for a sprint: use it to check your understanding throughout the sprint.
