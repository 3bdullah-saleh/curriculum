As self-educators, we must learn to continually evaluate our progress. For example, what should we learn in a sprint? Did we reach our goals? During the course, you can evaluate your progress against a sprint's **success page**. For each sprint, the **success** view will list all the **learning objectives** for any prep and workshops. It serves as an overview of your learning outcomes for a sprint: use this view to evaluate your progress during the sprint.
