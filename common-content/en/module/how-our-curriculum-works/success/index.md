As self-educators, we must learn to evaluate our progress. What do we intend to learn in a sprint? Were we successful in meeting our goals? During the course, you can evaluate your progress against a sprint's **success page**. For each sprint, the **success** view will list all the **learning objectives** for any blocks in the prep and workshops. It serves as an overview of your learning outcomes for a sprint: use this view to evaluate your progress during the sprint.
