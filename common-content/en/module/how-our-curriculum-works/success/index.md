Evaluating your own understanding is an essential part of self-learning: you'll need to continue checking your progress against the course's **learning objectives**. For each sprint week, you will have a **success** view on the sprint menu. The success view compiles the learning objectives for all the prep and workshops for a week. It serves as an overview of your learning outcomes for a given week: you can use it to check your own understanding at the end of a week.
