As self-educators, we must learn to continually evaluate our progress. For example, what should we learn in a sprint? Did we reach our goals? During the course, you must evaluate your progress against a sprint's **success page**. For each sprint, the **success** view will list all the **learning objectives** for any prep and workshops. It serves as an overview of your learning outcomes for a sprint. Use this view to evaluate your progress.

A module also has a success page, listing the overall learning objectives set by the Global team.  At the beginning of a module, review the objectives to understand what you are working towards. At the end of the module, review again to see how you did.
