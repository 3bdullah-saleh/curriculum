Cohorts meet every Saturday in person to develop their understanding of the current week's topics. We use a **day plan** to organise workshops, study sessions and activities to make the most of our time together on Saturdays. You can find day plans on a particular sprint view: each day plan consists of blocks with instructions for an activity together with a time.

### Steps ðŸ‘£

1. Go to the [module page for HTML-CSS](../../../html-css/)
1. Briefly check the day plans for each sprint in this module
1. Which blocks recur most often? Why do you think this is the case?
