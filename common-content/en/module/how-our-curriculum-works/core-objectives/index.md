To achieve our mission at Code Your Future, we have the following objectives

### Core objectives

#### - [We build communities that can self-educate](../sprints/self-educate)

#### - [We build communities that can self-coordinate](../sprints/self-coordinate)

#### - [We build communities that can self-evaluate](../sprints/self-evaluate)

Achieving these objectives is very challenging.

Our solution for achieving these objectives is our curriculum.
