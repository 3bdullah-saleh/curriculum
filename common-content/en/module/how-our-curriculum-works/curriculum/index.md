Our {{<tooltip title="curriculum" >}}
is a highly structured organisation of resources and tools to guide a community in its educational development.
{{</tooltip>}} is a FOSS educational project built by members of our community. Its purpose is to equip communities with the resources they need to launch a career in the tech industry. The curriculum is our collective solution to the mission of empowering communities to **self educate**, **self coordinate** and **self evaluate**.

The How our curriculum works module is split into three sections: **self educate**, **self coordinate** and **self evaluate**. For each section, you'll need to start with the prep section to introduce yourself to new concepts before using the backlog to understand how you can start engaging with the community.
