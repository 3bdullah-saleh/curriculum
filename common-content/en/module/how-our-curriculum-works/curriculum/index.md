Our {{<tooltip title="curriculum" >}}
is a highly structured organisation of resources and tools to guide a community in its educational development.
{{</tooltip>}} is a FOSS educational project built by members of our community. Its purpose is to equip communities with the resources they need to launch a career in the tech industry. The curriculum is our collective solution to the mission of empowering communities to **self educate**, **self coordinate** and **self evaluate**.

The rest of this module is split into three section: **self educate**, **self coordinate** and **self evaluate**. Each section concerns itself with the question of how the curriculum can be used to achieve each of these community goals. For each section, you'll need to start with the prep section to introduce yourself to new concepts before using the backlog to understand how you can start engaging with the community.
