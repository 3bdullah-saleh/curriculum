Code review is one of the most important ways we evaluate our progress on the course. The purpose of code review is not to mark or grade a piece of work: it must stand as a set of constructive feedback that trainees can use to correct any misconceptions and improve the quality of the code. Trainees benefit enormously from code reviews and often cite them as one of the most important ways of developing their skills.

Throughout the course, trainees will regularly raise pull requests for the backlog issues they're working on. New members of our community are encouraged to review code as early on as possible: talk to a current volunteer or trainee and they can direct you to a repo where there are outstanding pull requests. Ask on Slack to discover a list of pull requests that require a review.
