Code review is how we evaluate our work. Code review isn't about grading; a code review initiates a **dialogue** with constructive feedback. Learners benefit enormously from such code reviews and identify them as one of the most important ways of developing their skills.

It's also how we develop professional technical communication ability, which is one of the most valuable skills we can give people on this course. 

Often learners try to speedrun the curriculum by "completing" all the coursework and moving on to the next thing without a backwards glance. This leads to weak or absent comprehension. 

It is not valuable to "complete" work, without ever checking we _understand_ it.   The learning is in the review process. This means _you reply_ to the comments and make changes based on feedback. This is how you develop your skills.

Throughout the course, trainees regularly raise pull requests for their backlog issues. We recommend you begin to review code pull requests as soon as you begin volunteering: ask on Slack to discover unreviewed pull requests.
