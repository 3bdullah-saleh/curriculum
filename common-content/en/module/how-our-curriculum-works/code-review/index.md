As developers, code review is one of the most important ways we evaluate our work. At Code Your Future, code review isn't about grading; a code review initiates a **dialogue** with constructive feedback. Trainees benefit enormously from such code reviews and identify them as one of the most important ways of developing their skills.

Throughout the course, trainees regularly raise pull requests for their backlog issues. New volunteers are encouraged to review code pull requests early on: ask on Slack to discover unreviewed pull requests.
