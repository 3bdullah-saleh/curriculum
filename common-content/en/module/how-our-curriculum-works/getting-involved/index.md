The best way to understand how CodeYourFuture works is by attending an in-person session, usually held on a Saturday. In these sessions, you'll have the opportunity to meet the community and work out their needs directly.

- ### Start a discussion with a group of trainees or an individual trainee. Talk to them about a problem they're working on

- ### Start a discussion with some of the current volunteers. What challenges are they currently facing?

- ### Do a code review. Pair up with a volunteer and do a code review. Trainees always need code review and it's a great way to start giving feedback

- ### Participate in a workshop
