At the end of most modules, you'll be expected to build a **product**. You'll have to draw on the skills and concepts you've developed throughout the module to build a working deployed product that you can use on your portfolio. As products require you to use all the skills you've developed in a module, they are an excellent way of evaluating your progress on a module. Your final project must be deployed and easily accessible for employers and others to see the work you've produced on the course.
