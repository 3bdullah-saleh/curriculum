To achieve our mission, we bring people together to build self-empowered communities of learners. To this end, we have 3 community goals for achieving our mission:

### We build communities that can **self-educate**

**Self educate** means the ability to draw on surrounding resources to learn new skills and concepts. In an rapidly evolving tech landscape the ability to self-educate is essential.

### We build communities that can self-coordinate

### We build communities that can self-evaluate
