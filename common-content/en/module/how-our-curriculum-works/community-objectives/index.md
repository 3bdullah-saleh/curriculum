At Code Your Future, we believe in the power of communities. We bring people together - trainees and volunteers - with the common purpose of achieving our mission.

To this end, we have 3 community objectives we have for achieving our mission:

#### - [We build communities that can self-educate](../sprints/self-educate)

#### - [We build communities that can self-coordinate](../sprints/self-coordinate)

#### - [We build communities that can self-evaluate](../sprints/self-evaluate)

Achieving these objectives is very challenging.

Our solution for achieving these objectives is our curriculum.
