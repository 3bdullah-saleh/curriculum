[CYF Workshops](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/) are a crucial part of how we encourage active learning in our community.
Workshops are group activities where the community discusses, solves and reflects on problems related to their current sprint. They are an opportunity for practice, critical thinking and dialogue.

You can find our workshops here at this repo: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/CYF-Workshops/
Check out some examples and raise a PR if you've got an idea for a new workshop.
