Self-coordinating as a community poses several challenges. One of these challenges involves working out not just what to do but _when_ to do it. This becomes even more challenging with members of the community working on different schedules. To further complicate matters we use a flipped classroom model - much different from a conventional educational setting.

To solve this problem, we use the **rhythm of the week**.

   Backlog :2024-01-11, 5d
   Demo :2024-01-12, 1d
```

This rhythm enables trainees to plan their work during the week whilst still allowing flexibility in people's different schedules. In a typical sprint week, **Tuesday is the starting point** with in-person sessions on **Saturdays serving as the mid-point in the week**. Sundays and Mondays are used for trainees to reflect on their learning and finish off any backlog tasks.
