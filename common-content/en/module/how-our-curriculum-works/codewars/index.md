[Codewars](https://docs.codewars.com/) is an online code challenge platform that allows users to hone their skills on thousands of katas. Users can earn certain rankings based on the number and difficulty of the Codewars katas they've completed. The platform is useful for developing problem-solving skills and improving your fluency in a programming language. Another key advantage is _immediate feedback_. Users can check their programming solutions with pre-built test suites, gaining very quick feedback.
