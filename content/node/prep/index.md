## Install Postman

Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

### Issues

If you get

> `error while loading shared libraries: libgconf-2.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

You may first need to run this in the terminal:

`sudo apt-get install -y libgconf-2-4`

### Alternatives

If you have an old computer you might find Postman being very slow or becoming unresponsive. In this case you could try:

- [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/): this VS Code extension has a similar user interface to Postman
- [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/): this web app runs in the browser.
