### Create a cyf folder on your hard drive

Create a CYF folder to store your work on the course.

1. Open a terminal on your computer.

For each of the steps below, you'll need to use the command line in your terminal.

Use this [cli documentation](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/) to remember terminal commands.

2. In your terminal, print your current working directory.
3. List the files and folders in your current working directory.

You'll need a place to store your work for the CYF course.

4. Make a new directory called `cyf` in your home directory.
5. Change directory into the `cyf` directory.
6. Using the terminal, use a command to create a new directory called `cyf`. You'll use this directory to store the files and folders in your project.
7. Change your working directory to the `cyf` directory. Double check you're in the right by printing your current directory.
