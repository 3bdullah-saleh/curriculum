## For trainees

In this section, we're going to go through a set of questions/tasks to clarify what we're going to do in the next part of the course.

Get into pairs with somebody you've not paired up with today and try figuring out the answers/solutions to the following questions/tasks:

1. Using the [curriculum website](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/), find the page with the prep material for the upcoming module
2. List the things you need to install ( if anything ) for the upcoming module.
3. Check you can find the backlog page for the upcoming module.
4. Go to your Slack helpdesk channel and start a thread ðŸ§µ outlining times you're free to meet up to discuss the prep work during the week

## For volunteers

1. Check you can find the classroom planning board for volunteers
2. Check you can find the day-plan for the upcoming week.
