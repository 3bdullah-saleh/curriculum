## üìù CYF blog

Imagine a scenario where 2 people are writing a blog.
Ahmed and Naima are co-authoring this blog to document the things they're struggling with whilst learning to code.

The published blog is live here üëâ [CYF educational blog](https://git-demo-week1.netlify.app/)

{{<note type="exercise" title="exercise 1.1">}}
Try exploring the site above. Try clicking around different links on the site and check to see if they're working.
{{</note>}}

## üß∞ Work process

Ahmed and Naima are currently using the following **work process** for writing the blog:

- writing the blog in a single file on a **single** computer
- saving multiple versions of the file on the same computer
- they take it in turns to the use the computer at different points in the day

At the moment, the computer has a folder with the blog that looks like this:

![different-blog-versions](different-blog-versions.png)

{{<note type="exercise" title="exercise 1.2">}}

Describe some of the challenges that Ahmed and Naima face when trying to write a blog together in this way.
Try asking on Slack to see if your cohort colleagues came up with similar answers.

## ‚åõ Version control software

> To improve their way of working, Ahmed and Naima realise they need the following:
>
> - a way to create and manage the different versions of their project
> - a way to share the history of the project between different users

To manage the different versions of the blog project, they decide to use Git.

{{<note type="definition" title="definition">}}

Git is **version control software** that allows developers to create and manage different versions of a project.

{{</note>}}

In Git, we create different versions of a project over time by creating a **commit**.

A **commit** is a snapshot of our project at a particular point in time. You can also think of a **commit** as a particular version of a project.

**Commits** will give us the following informationüëç

- what changed in this commit
- who created the change
- what time the change happen
- what the previous commit was

A typical timeline of commits might look like this:

![commit-history](commit-history.png)

## üóÑÔ∏è üåê Sharing history

Earlier on, Ahmed and Naima realised they needed the following:

> a way to share the history of the project between different users

To share a project and its history, we can use an online platform called **Github**

**Github** is an online platform where teams can store their projects and histories online.

{{<note type="definition" title="Definition">}}
On Github we call our project and its history a **repository**.
{{</note>}}

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise 2.1">}}

### Explore üîç

In this exercise, you'll need to explore a **Github repository.**

You'll need to look around and figure out where to find different files and find out information about them.

**‚ö†Ô∏è You won't be expected to know what the files do at this stage.**

Go to the following link: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog

It will take you to a Github repository called **education-blog**.

Answer the following questions using the page linked to above:

a) Look at the README.md. What do the instructions tell you?
b) How many files are there inside the `blogs` folder?
c) How many lines are there in the **package.json**?
d) Find the file with the blog content you can see on the [live website here](https://git-demo-week1.netlify.app/)

{{</note>}}

We can use the Github interface to explore the different **commits** ( versions ) of the project.

{{<note type="exercise" title="exercise 2.2">}}

### Explore üîç

Go to the following link: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog/commits/main

Try answering the following questions:

Go to the commit that says "add test p element to index page"

![highlight-2nd-commit.png](./highlight-2nd-commit.png)

Try answering the following questions:

- How many files were changed in this commit?
- Who created the change?
- What time did the change take place?

{{</note>}}

## Previous versions

We have a need for a way of creating and managing different versions of our project over time.

{{<note type="exercise" title="exercise 3.1">}}

Here are some links to the different versions of the same CYF educational backlog

[Version A educational blog](https://64b6fd80d14d510008aab4aa--git-demo-week1.netlify.app)
[Version B educational blog](https://64b6f8e6044ccc0742386430--git-demo-week1.netlify.app/)
[Version C educational blog](https://64b6fd80d14d510008aab4aa--git-demo-week1.netlify.app/)

Answer the following questions:
a) What is the difference between Version A and Version B on the README page.

## üç¥ Forking a repository

Often we want to take an existing project and start working on it independently: in other words, we start making our own versions of the project separate from the original project.

We may have a repo will the following url:
![lesson1-github-url-anatomy](lesson1-github-url-anatomy.png)

We might want to start creating our version of this project in isolation from the original project.

So we can create a **fork**.

{{<note type="definition" title="definition">}}
A **fork** is a copy of a repository that exists on Github

{{</note>}}

When we create a fork on Github, the new forked repository gets a new url:
![lesson1-forked-url-anatomy](lesson1-forked-url-anatomy.png)

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise 5.1">}}

### üç¥ Forking a repo

Visit the following https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog and firstly locate the Fork button on this page.

Click on the Fork button to create a new fork of the repository and set yourself as the owner of the fork.

üìã How can you check you successfully forked the original repository?

{{<details summary="hint">}}
Hint: Check the url of your forked repository
{{</details>}}

{{</note>}}

## üíª Working locally

We can also use Git on our local machine to perform similar tasks as we do on Github. So we have the following question:

{{<note type="question" title="‚ùì">}}

How can we get a local copy of an existing Github repository on our local machine.

{{</note>}}

In other words, we need to get a copy of the repository on Github on to our device.

{{<note type="note" title="cloning">}}

We call a local copy of a Github repository a **clone**.

The process of copying a remote repo on to a local machine is known as **cloning**.

{{</note>}}

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise 6.1 - üë£ Follow the steps">}}

###

> üéØ Goal: Clone a remote repository to your local machine

You'll need to use the information below so we can achieve the following goal:

You'll need to clone the following repository üëâ https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/education-blog

To achieve this goal, follow through the steps in this video üëâ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILJ4dfOL7zs

## üìò¬†Viewing the files

Once you've got a local copy of a codebase on your local machine you can start to view the files and folders in that codebase. You can use a code editor like VSCode.

VSCode is an application that enables developers to view and edit files on their local machine.

{{<note type="exercise" title="Exercise">}}

Figure out how to open the cloned repository on your local machine in VSCode.

Explore the repository in VSCode and use the code editor to look at the various files and folders.
