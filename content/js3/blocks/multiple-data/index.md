We can take a single datum and render it in the UI. However, we will often have larger data structures that hold collections of data that we want to render in the user interface. Let's consider the folllowing:

Let's consider an array of data like this:

```js
const shows = [
  {
    name: "Little Simz",
    date: "5th November",
    location: "02 Victoria Warehouse",
    city: "Manchester",
  },
  {
    name: "Little Simz",
    date: "5th November",
    location: "02 Victoria Warehouse",
    city: "Manchester",
  },
];

const cards = [];
for (const item of shows) {
  cards.push(createShowCard(item));
}

document.querySelector("ul").append(...elements);
// invoke append using the spread operator
```

We want to map over this data and render it in the user interface.

```js
const shows = [
  {
    name: "Little Simz",
    date: "5th November",
    location: "02 Victoria Warehouse",
    city: "Manchester",
  },
  {
    name: "Little Simz",
    date: "5th November",
    location: "02 Victoria Warehouse",
    city: "Manchester",
  },
];

const elements = [];
for (const item of items) {
  const userCard = createUserCard(item);
  elements.push(userCard);
}

document.querySelector("#main-content").append(...elements);
```

Now we have a situation where we want to map elements from the DOM to a user interface.
