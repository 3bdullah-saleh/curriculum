> ðŸŽ¯ Sub-goal: Build a film card component

To break down this problem, we'll render a single datum, before doing this for the whole list. Here's one film:

```js
const film = {
    title: "Killing of Flower Moon",
    director: "Martin Scoresese"
    times: ["15:35"],
    certificate: "15",
    duration: 112
};
```

Starting with this object, we'll focus _only_ on building this section of the user interface:
