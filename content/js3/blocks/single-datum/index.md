To break down this problem, let's define a sub-goal:

> ðŸŽ¯ Sub-goal: Render _any_ single datum in the user interface

We'll consider how to render a single datum before doing this for the whole list. We will start with an object like the one below:

```js
const show = {
  event: "Little Simz concert",
  date: "5th November",
  location: "02 Victoria Warehouse",
  city: "Manchester",
};
```

How can we **render** this data in the user interface?
