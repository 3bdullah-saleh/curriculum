To break down this problem, let's define a sub-goal:

> ðŸŽ¯ Sub-goal: Render _any_ single film datum in the user interface

We'll consider how to render a single datum before doing this for the whole list. We will start with an object like the one below:

```js
const film = {
    title: "Killing of Flower Moon",
    director: "Martin Scoresese"
    times: ["15:35"],
    certificate: "15",
    duration: 112
};
```

How can we **render** this data in the user interface?
