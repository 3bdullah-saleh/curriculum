We can now render _any_ film data object in the UI. However, to fully solve this problem we must render a list of data. For each film object we need to render a corresponding film object in the UI. There is a {{<tooltip title="one-to-one mapping">}}A **one-to-one mapping** associates every element in a set to exactly one element in another set{{</tooltip>}}between the data array and the UI components we see on the web page. We can represent this diagrammatically by pairing up the data elements with their corresponding UI components:

```mermaid

   A[datum1] == createFilmCard(datum1) ==> B[UI component 1]
   C[datum2] == createFilmCard(datum2) ==> D[UI component 2]
```

We can take any single film datum and render it in the UI. However, the main goal is to render a list of data in the user interface:

Let's consider an array of data like this:

```js
const films = [
  {
    title: "Killing of Flower Moon",
    director: "Martin Scoresee"
    times: ["15:35"],
    certificate: "15",
    duration: 112
  },
  {
    title: "Typist Artist Pirate King",
    directory: "Carol Morley"
    times: ["15:00", "20:00"],
    certificate: "12A",
    duration: 108
  },
];

const filmCards = [];
for (const item of films) {
  filmCards.push(createFilmCard(item));
}

document.querySelector("ul").append(...elements);
// invoke append using the spread operator
```

We want to map over this data and render it in the user interface.

```js
const films = [
  {
    title: "Killing of Flower Moon",
    director: "Martin Scoresee"
    times: ["15:35"],
    certificate: "15",
    duration: 112
  },
  {
    title: "Typist Artist Pirate King",
    directory: "Carol Morley"
    times: ["15:00", "20:00"],
    certificate: "12A",
    duration: 108
  },
];

const filmCards = [];
for (const item of filmCards) {
  const filmCard = createFilmCard(item);
  filmCards.push(filmCard);
}

document.querySelector("#main-content").append(...filmCards);
```

Now we have a situation where we want to map elements from the DOM to a user interface.
