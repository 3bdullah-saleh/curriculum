There is a {{<tooltip title="one to one association">}}A **one-to-one mapping** associates every element in a set to exactly one element in another set{{</tooltip>}}between the data array and the UI components. We can represent this diagrammatically by pairing up the data elements with their corresponding UI components:

```mermaid

   A[datum1] == createFilmCard(datum1) ==> B[UI component 1]
   C[datum2] == createFilmCard(datum2) ==> D[UI component 2]
