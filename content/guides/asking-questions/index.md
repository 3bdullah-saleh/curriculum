Often trainees at Code Your Future find it difficult to get help. This is because we are dealing with complicated questions that people need lots of details about to be able to answer.

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Asking Questions workshop" >}}-->

If you have not completed the [Asking Questions workshop](../../html-css/sprints/2/day-plan/index.md#asking-questions) during the HTML-CSS module, find a small group of people to do that together before reading further.

It is important to understand how your current mental model helps you to ask a good question.

## Building your mental model

As we learned in the Asking Questions workshop, it is important to share your current mental model to help you ask an {{<tooltip title="effective question">}}Questions are _effective_ when they are more likely to receive an answer.{{</tooltip>}}.

Before asking a question, make sure that you have:

1. Made a prediction and explain why you think that will happen
1. Run the code
1. Compared your prediction against what actually happened

Now, write up your mental model using this format:

1. What I _did_
1. What I _expected_. Make sure you include your prediction here
1. What actually _happened_

To debug code, mentors need to be able to see and work with the exact code you are running. To help solve problems, mentors need to understand the exact problem you are working on. So when you ask questions, to get proper help quickly, put as much **context** into your question as you can.

In order to make it possible for people to answer your questions when asking for help, it's important that you give, at minimum, the following information:

- The homework that you're working on
- What isn't working in your code, or what you don't understand
- What you expect to happen
- A link to your pull request or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [Replit](https://replit.com/) (not a screenshot)

### Use this template:

{{<note type="question" title=" Request for help">}}
**Coursework:**

**Problem:**

**Expected:**

**Code:**
{{</note>}}

#### For example

{{<note type="question" title=" Request for help">}}
**Coursework:** [HTML-CSS Module Project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-HTML-CSS/tree/main/Form-Controls) (Form Controls)

**Problem:** The headings on my website don't look right.

**Expected:** The heading should be much bigger than the other text on the page. I've tried to use a H1 tag but it doesn't seem to do anything.

**Code:** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-HTML-CSS/pull/1234

### Question Check List

Before asking a question check in with yourself and make sure you have done the following:

### I have...

- [ ] **done** some _research_ myself
- [ ] **explained** what Iâ€™ve already _tried_ to solve my problem
- [ ] **specified** which language and platform I'm using, including version number where relevant
- [ ] **written** my code as a short but complete program
- [ ] **formatted** my code
- [ ] **checked** my spelling and grammar
- [ ] **pasted** the exact error message, if there is one
- [ ] **stated** what I expected, why I expected it, and the actual results
- [ ] **read** the whole question carefully, to make sure it makes sense and contains enough information for someone coming to it without any of the **context that I already know**?

### After you've asked your question you should check:

- Are you monitoring your questions and replying to people giving their time to help you?
- Have you been asked for a [Minimum Reproducible Example](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/trainees/guides/common-responses/create-a-minimal-reproducible-example)?
- Have you posted an easy to understand answer to your questions that includes everything you learnt

By completing all of these steps you make it really easy for other students to learn from your question and for you to get help quickly. Together, you and your colleagues will build up a shared knowledge base you can search and share.

You also make yourself a better developer. Describing problems clearly and systematically is an important skill for a developer.
