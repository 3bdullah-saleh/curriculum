Often trainees at Code Your Future find it difficult to get help. This is because we are dealing with complicated questions that people need lots of details about to be able to answer.

<!--{{<note type="activity" title="Asking Questions workshop" >}}-->

If you have not completed the [Asking Questions workshop](../../html-css/sprints/2/day-plan/index.md#asking-questions) during the HTML-CSS module, find a small group of people to do that together before reading further.

It is important to understand how your current mental model helps you to ask a good question.

## Building your mental model

As we learned in the Asking Questions workshop, it is important to share your current mental model to help you ask an {{<tooltip title="effective question">}}Questions are _effective_ when they are more likely to receive an answer.{{</tooltip>}}.

Before asking a question, make sure that you have:

1. Made a prediction and explain why you think that will happen
1. Run the code
1. Compared your prediction against what actually happened

Now, write up your mental model using this format:

1. What I _did_
1. What I _expected_
1. What actually _happened_

## Sharing your mental model

To be able to fully understand your mental model, volunteers need to have **context**. So it's important that you share at least the following information:

- The problem that you're working on. If it's a coursework task, include a link to the task
- What you have done so far
- What you predicted would happen before you ran the code
- What actually happened
- The exact code that you are running. **Don't include a screenshot of your code**, see [code formatting tips below](#code-formatting-tips)

### Question template

Use this template:

{{<note type="question" title=" Request for help">}}
**Coursework:**

**Problem:**

**Expected:**

**Code:**
{{</note>}}

#### For example

{{<note type="question" title=" Request for help">}}
**Coursework:** [HTML-CSS Module Project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-HTML-CSS/tree/main/Form-Controls) (Form Controls)

**Problem:** The headings on my website don't look right.

**Expected:** The heading should be much bigger than the other text on the page. I've tried to use a H1 tag but it doesn't seem to do anything.

**Code:** https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Module-HTML-CSS/pull/1234

## Code formatting tips

#### Tips for posting questions on Slack

Your question will be **much** more likely to be answered if other people can read it properly! Here's some tips on formatting your questions on Slack:

1. **Never** take a screenshot of your code and share this - it forces people to zoom into a tiny image of your code! Pasting your code as text is much easier to read
1. Use a [code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/204145658-Create-or-paste-code-snippets-in-Slack) to paste bits of code. This will make your code look like code, and not just a "normal" message
1. Try making a [Minimal Reproducible Example](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/trainees/guides/common-responses/create-a-minimal-reproducible-example). It's easier to provide help if other people can run your code!

### Question Check List

Before asking a question check in with yourself and make sure you have done the following:

### I have...

- [ ] **done** some _research_ myself
- [ ] **explained** what Iâ€™ve already _tried_ to solve my problem
- [ ] **specified** which language and platform I'm using, including version number where relevant
- [ ] **written** my code as a short but complete program
- [ ] **formatted** my code
- [ ] **checked** my spelling and grammar
- [ ] **pasted** the exact error message, if there is one
- [ ] **stated** what I expected, why I expected it, and the actual results
- [ ] **read** the whole question carefully, to make sure it makes sense and contains enough information for someone coming to it without any of the **context that I already know**?

### After you've asked your question you should check:

- Are you monitoring your questions and replying to people giving their time to help you?
- Have you been asked for a [Minimum Reproducible Example](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/trainees/guides/common-responses/create-a-minimal-reproducible-example)?
- Have you posted an easy to understand answer to your questions that includes everything you learnt

By completing all of these steps you make it really easy for other students to learn from your question and for you to get help quickly. Together, you and your colleagues will build up a shared knowledge base you can search and share.

You also make yourself a better developer. Describing problems clearly and systematically is an important skill for a developer.
