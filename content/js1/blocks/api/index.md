    1='Explain why we use APIs in programming'
+++

With Jest installed, we need to figure out _how to use the Jest framework_ to write tests.
Jest provides an **API** so we can use its functionality.

API stands for

- **Application**
- **Programming**
- **Interface**.

We've encountered the word **interface** already.

But we can break down each word in this acronym to understand it altogether.

- An **application** is a program or piece of software designed to serve some purpose.
- **Programming** refers to the process of writing code or software.
- An üïπÔ∏è**interface** is a shared boundary across which two or more systems.

{{<note type="Definition" title="Definition - API">}}

An **API** is a boundary between a programmer and an application, enabling a programmer to use an application‚Äôs functionality without being concerned with how the application was built.

We‚Äôve encountered several functions like `console.log`, `Math.round` already.
`console.log` and `Math.round` are **API**s.

### üîç Figure it out

There should be one more change to your project after running the installation command. Use documentation or ChatGPT to figure out what this change is for.
