With Jest installed, we need to figure out _how to use the Jest framework_ to write tests.

Jest provides an {{<tooltip title="API">}}An **API** is a boundary between a programmer and an application, enabling a programmer to use an application‚Äôs functionality without being concerned with how the application was built.{{</tooltip>}} so we can write tests.

API stands for

- **Application**
- **Programming**
- **Interface**.

We've encountered the word **interface** already.

But we can break down each word in this acronym to understand it altogether.

- An **application** is a program or piece of software designed to serve some purpose.

- **Programming** refers to the process of writing code or software.

- An üïπÔ∏è**interface** is a shared boundary across which two or more systems.

There should be one more change to your project after running the installation command. Use documentation or ChatGPT to figure out what this change is for.
