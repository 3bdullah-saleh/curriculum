We’re going to focus on the JavaScript programming language.

A programming language organises data with rules. They split data up into different categories called **data types**. In JavaScript, we have five data types. We will look first at numbers and strings.

{{<note title="Definition: data types" type="info">}}
A **data type** is a grouping of data with some particular properties.

#### Number data type

`10` is an example of the number data type.
`3.14` is also part of the number data type; non-integers are a type of number.

#### String data type

A string is a sequence of characters demarcated by quotes.

```js
"Code Your Future"`
```

## 🧮 Creating expressions

Think of the numbers `10` and `32`. We could ask questions about these numbers, like: _What is the **sum** of 10 and 32?_

Another way to say this is _what do 10 and 32 add up to?_. We can say this in many ways, but in JavaScript we can say this using numbers and an operator. Just like in mathematics, “the sum of 10 and 32” can be written as `10 + 32`:

```raw
10 + 32
```

In JavaScript, `+` is an operator: an **operator** represents an operation, or act. It's a symbol. In this example, `+` represents the operation “make the sum of the numbers”. It symbolises addition.

The combination of symbols `10 + 32` is an **expression**.

{{<note title="Definition: expression" type="info">}}
An **expression** is a value or any valid combination of values and symbols that results in a single value.

We say that expressions **evaluate** to a single value.
So we say that `10 + 32` **evaluates** to the value `42`.

`10` is also an expression. It **evaluates** to the value `10`.
