So far we‚Äôve seen how expressions can be evaluated using the Node REPL. The Node REPL is a very useful tool for evaluating expressions quickly.

Usually, our programs have many instructions, and we want to keep and re-run them, so we write them to files. Instead of using the REPL mode, Node can execute instructions written in a file.

We use the `node` command to run a JavaScript file in the terminal. A JavaScript file ends with `.js` - this is the "file extension".

Let‚Äôs suppose we have a file `arithmetic.js`. We issue the command `node arithmetic.js`. This terminal command is an instruction to execute the program written inside arithmetic.js. Our program has 3 lines, each line an expression. So the computer will go through the file line by line:

```js
10 + 3; // the computer will evaluate this expression
10 * 3; // then this expression
10 / 3; // then this expression
```

### Check you can run a file with Node:

1. In your terminal, create a new file called `example.js`.
2. Try writing a few expressions in the file.
3. Get Node to run this file. (Don't use the REPL now - you should run a command to execute the whole file.)

{{</note>}}

Once the computer evaluates these expressions, the execution of the program is complete. But we‚Äôre left with a problem. With the REPL, the user inputs an expression, the computer evaluates it and then prints the result. But now the computer will go and execute each line sequentially until completion _without_ printing the values of each expression it evaluates.

So this new problem can be expressed as a question:
