    1='Execute a JavaScript file with Node'
+++

So far we‚Äôve seen how expressions can be evaluated using the Node REPL. The Node REPL is useful for evaluating expressions quickly.

But usually, our programs have many instructions, and we want to keep and re-run them instead of typing them out each time. So we save our instructions in files. Node can also execute instructions written in a file.

We use the `node` command to run a JavaScript file in the terminal. A JavaScript file ends with `.js` - this is the "file extension".

Let‚Äôs suppose we have a file `arithmetic.js`. We issue the command `node arithmetic.js`. This terminal command is an instruction to execute the program written inside arithmetic.js. Our program has 3 lines, each line an expression. So the computer will go through the file line by line:

```js
10 + 3; // the computer will evaluate this expression
10 * 3; // then this expression
10 / 3; // then this expression
```

### Check you can run a file with Node:

1. In your terminal, create a new file called `example.js`.
2. Try writing a few expressions in the file.
3. Get Node to run this file. (Don't use the REPL now - you should run a command to execute the whole file.)

{{</note>}}

Once the computer evaluates these expressions, the execution of the program is complete. But we‚Äôre left with a problem. With the REPL, the user inputs an expression, the computer evaluates it and then prints the result. But now the computer will go and execute each line sequentially until completion _without_ printing the values of each expression it evaluates.

So this new problem can be expressed as a question:
