Let's start with a function declaration of `formatAs12HourClock` like this:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
function formatAs12HourClock() {}
```

Whenever we call `formatAs12HourClock` we expect it to return a particular value, which we call the üéØ **target output**.

For example, we expect `formatAs12HourClock("08:00")` to return `"08:00 am"`.
In this case, `"08:00 am"` is the üéØ **target output**.

However, the **current output** is what the function actually returns given its current implementation.

{{<tab name="Exercise 1">}}

Let's start with `formatAs12HourClock` defined like this:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
function formatAs12HourClock() {}
```

Suppose we now call the function like this:

```js
formatAs12HourClock("05:30");
```

For the call above, what is the

a) the current output?
b) the üéØ target output?

Let's continue with `formatAs12HourClock` defined like this:

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
function formatAs12HourClock() {}
```

Suppose we call the function like this:

```js
formatAs12HourClock("20:10");
```

For the call above, what is the

a) the current output?
b) the üéØ target output?

Previously we learned how to log values to the console, but we can also **compare** two values.
Comparisons are essential whenever we want to check that a function produces some target output.

We can compare the current output of `formatAs12HourClock("08:00")` with the target output of `"08:00 am"` and ask: **are these 2 values the same?**.
We can use a comparison operator to compare 2 expressions and check if they evaluate to the same value. In particular, we can use the [strict equality operator `===`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality), a comparison operator used to check if two values are the same.

We can write an expression as follows:

```js
formatAs12HourClock("08:00") === "8:00 am";
```

In the code above, `===` will check the values on the left and the right of the operator to see if they‚Äôre the same.

We can think of `formatAs12HourClock("08:00") === "8:00 am"`

as being like the question:

Is the return value of `formatAs12HourClock("08:00")` equal to `"8:00 am"` ?

This leads to the question:

> What will the expression `formatAs12HourClock("08:00") === "8:00 am"` evaluate to?

## ‚úÖ ‚ùå Boolean values

Some values are best represented as strings: any piece of text, a name, address, etc will most likely be stored using the string data type.

Similarly, we can use the number data type to store any numerical data where we'll need to use standard numerical operations like addition, multiplication etc.

However, if we're comparing values or expressions, we have one of 2 different states: **true** or **false**.

This leads us to the [**boolean** datatype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean), which only has two different values: **true** or **false**.

Whenever we compare two values with a comparison operator, we end up with a boolean value: `true` or `false`.

For example:

```js
// using the strict equality comparison expression

console.log(42 === 10 + 32);
// logs true

console.log(10 * 5 === 60);
// logs false
```

Look at the code below and then try predicting how the computer will interpret each line. Remember to think about each line and work out if it is a declaration or a statement.
You may want to use the Node REPL to help you check your answers.

Check out some relevant documentation if you've never seen a particular operator.

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
true === false;
5 == 2 + 4;
4 * 5 == "20";
3 * 2 === 6;
Math.min(3, 4, 5) === 4;
let mhairiName = "Mhairi";
typeof mhairiName === "string";
let mhairiAge = 28;
let isMhairOldEnoughToDrive = true;
let kilometersMhairiDrivesToWork = 9.4;
"hello Mhairi" === `hello ${mhairiName}`;
"${mhairiName} is 28" === `Mhairi is ${mhairiAge}`;
isMhairOldEnoughToDrive;
isMhairOldEnoughToDrive === true;
mhairiAge >= 18;
29 <= mhairiAge;
Math.round(kilometersMhairiDrivesToWork) === 9;
```

Some functions like [`includes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes) **return booleans**.

```js
const firstName = "Mariana";
console.log(firstName.includes("a"));
console.log(firstName.includes("M"));
console.log(firstName.includes("m"));
```

Step through the code above and use documentation to explain what the `includes` function will return on each call.

### Checking misconceptions ü§î

Look at the code below and then try predicting and explaining what the expression will evaluate to.

Try using the Node Repl to check your answer. Does the REPL output make sense?

```js {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
console.log(10 + 32) === 42;
```
