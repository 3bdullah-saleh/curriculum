So for `formatAs12HourClock` we said part of the strategy for handling `"23:00"` would involve checking that the `hours` value is less than 12. For this purpose, we can use another comparison operator: `>`.
`>` will check if the value on the operator's left side is less than the value on the operator's right side.

So `3 > 12` would evaluate to be `false`, as `3` is not greater than `12`.

So provided we have an expression for hours, we can write an `if` statement as follows:

```js
if ( /* here goes an expression that evaluates to the hours from the time */ < 12) {
  // do code to format the 12 hours
}
```

To complete the logic, we now have to achieve a sub-goal:

> ðŸŽ¯ Sub-goal: Find the hours value from the `time` input
