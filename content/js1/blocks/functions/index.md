Now, instead of adding or multiplying numbers, we‚Äôll consider `10.3`.

> ü§î "What is the nearest whole number to `10.3`?"

The process of finding the nearest whole number to a decimal number is called **rounding**. So we could rephrase our question as:

> ü§î "What does the number `10.3` **round** to?‚Äù

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusing instructions

There is no arithmetical operator for rounding the number `10.3` in JavaScript. But we will want to round numbers **again and again**. We should use a **function**.

{{<note title="Definition: function" type="info">}}

A **function** is a reusable set of instructions.

{{</note>}}

`Math.round` is an example of a function. Recalling the definition, a function is a reusable set of instructions: `Math.round` contains instructions for rounding any number.

Functions will often take **inputs** and then **apply their set of instructions to the inputs** to produce an **output**.

We can write `Math.round` in the Node REPL:

![round-img](math.round-img.png)

After we've hit enter to evaluate our expression, we then get the following:

![round-img](math.round-evaluated.png)

So in this case, the REPL output `[Function: round]` is indicating that `Math.round` is a function.

## üì≤ Calling a function

Once we have the name for a function, we need to get Node to read the function's instructions and execute them. Execution means the computer reads the instructions and carries them out. So we can write the following in the REPL:

![round-img](math.round-number-10.3.png)

Notice now we have `(` and `)` brackets after the name of the function and a number inside the brackets. The brackets indicate that we are calling the function. The number inside the brackets is the **input** we're passing to the function.

{{<note title="Calling a function" type="note">}}

**Calling a function** means telling the computer to read the function's instructions and carry out its instructions. When calling a function we can also pass inputs to the function.

{{</note>}}

`Math.round(10.3)` is a call expression; you can read this as:

"apply the set of instructions for `Math.round` to the number `10.3`."

If we type `Math.round(10.3)` then we get the result 10.
So we say that `Math.round(10.3)` returns 10.

A **call expression** is an **expression** which **evaluates** to the value returned by the function when it is called. So the expression `Math.round(10.3)` evaluates to the value `10`.

This means that if we assign that expression to a variable, or use it in a string, we'll get the value `10`. So we can write:

```js
const roundedValue = Math.round(10.3);
```

or we can write:

```js
const roundedValueInAString = `10.3 rounds to ${Math.round(10.3)}`;
```

Both of these instructions **evaluate** the call expression `Math.round(10.3)` to the returned value `10` as soon as the call expression appears. The variable `roundedValue` will have a numeric value `10` (just like if we'd written `const roundedValue = 10;`), and the variable `roundedValueInAString` will have a string value `"10.3 rounds to 10"`.
