    1='Identify the query parameters in a url'
+++

Let‚Äôs define a problem.

Websites have addresses called urls like this: "https://github.com/Dedekind561"

urls also make use of **query strings**:

"https://github.com/Dedekind561?tab=overview"

Query parameters go at the end of a url and are used to search for more specific content from a particular website.
Given a url, we'd like to access what the value of a query parameter is given a key.
For example, given the url `http://some-api.com?artist=beyonce` we'd like to ask what the value is associated with the key "artist". Accessing strings like this is tricky: it would be much easier if they key-value pairs where stored in an object.
For example, for a string like `"http://some-api.com?artist=beyonce"` we could use an object `{ artist: "beyonce" }`.

We're going to implement a function `parseQueryString` that takes a url string as an argument and
returns an object with the key-value pairs from the url.

So we can break this problem down into smaller sub-goals.

Let‚Äôs start with one sub-goal: get this function to work in the case when there are no query parameters.
In this particular case, we need to think of an output that makes sense. To convey the fact that there are no query parameters we can just return an empty object.
