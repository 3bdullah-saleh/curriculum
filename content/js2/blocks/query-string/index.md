Let‚Äôs define a problem.

Websites have addresses called urls like this: "https://example.com". Urls often have {{<tooltip title="query strings">}}Query strings go at the end of a url and are used to specify more information about the content you get back from a response{{</tooltip>}}too. Here is an example of a url with a query string on the end:

https://example.com/widgets?colour=blue&sort=newest

For the url above, the **query string** is `"colour=blue&sort=newest"`. Query strings consist of **key-value** pairs separated by an ampersand character `&`. urls must always be strings. However, a string isn't a useful structure for storing key-value pairs like this. Given a key, it is not straightforward accessing the value.
However, objects are ideal for storing data in this way.

We're going to implement a function `parseQueryString` to extract the key-value pairs from the string and store them in object form:

_Given_ a query string and a function `parseQueryString`,
_When_ we call `parseQueryString` with a query string,
_Then_ it should return an object with the key-value pairs

E.g.

```js
parseQueryString("colour=blue&sort=newest");
// returns { colour: "blue, sort: "newest" }`
```
