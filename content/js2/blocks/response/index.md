Reacting to interactions

Recall: As a user, we interact with elements on a web page. We click on things, we input text and we complete forms etc.
Currently, we have two functions - getUserInput, and countWords - we can call these functions manually. However, this doesnâ€™t fulfill step 3. In reality, we actually want the user to get feedback when they interact with the input element, In other words, everytime the user types in the box, we expect them to get feedback if theyâ€™ve typed another word.
