Now suppose we have a program where we use the functions we implemented earlier:

```js
const salaries = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 80];
const median = calculateMedian(salaries);
const mean = calculateMean(salaries);

console.log(`The median salary is ${median}`);
console.log(`The mean salary is ${mean}`);
```

Try running the code above on your local machine. Check the console output. What do you see? _(Note: You'll have to declare the functions somewhere too)_

### üêõ Finding the bug

In the code above, the `median` value is correct: however, the `mean` is _incorrect_.

We can add a log to the program to identify the origin of the bug.

```js {linenos=table,hl_lines=["4"],linenostart=1}
const salaries = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 80];
const median = calculateMedian(salaries);

console.log(salaries, "<--- salaries input before we call calculateMean");
const mean = calculateMean(salaries);

console.log(`The median salary is ${median}`);
console.log(`The mean salary is ${mean}`);
```

{{<note type="activity" title="Run it">}}
Try re-running the code above with the additional log. What does this tell you?

To understand why this bug occurs, we need to introduce more concepts.
