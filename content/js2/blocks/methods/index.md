As well as organising information in a meaningful way, we can also use functions to update the state meaningfully. A method is a function that acts on an object.

Letâ€™s consider an array like const heights = [1,4,5,6,7,10];
We can sort the heights like this `heights.sort()`

`.sort` is a method - it is a function that acts on the `heights` array. In particular, `sort` mutates the array, arrnaing the items by ascending order.

`sort()` also doesnâ€™t have any arguments when it is called but it can still refer to the `heights` array it was called on.

We can create another array weights = [10, 30, 50, 60];

`weights.sort()` here weâ€™re calling the same method `sort` but on a different `weights` array.

So we have a function `sort` that can

- be called upon to sort different arrays
- can refer to the array it was called upon
- mutates the array it was called upon

In a similar way, with objects we can implement methods that mutate the state of an object.

So with
