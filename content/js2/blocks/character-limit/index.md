Letâ€™s define a problem.

Weâ€™ll start with an input element as defined by some HTML. Weâ€™ll have a word limit on this input box so that users canâ€™t exceed a certain number of words. As users type in the box, they should get feedback on the number of words theyâ€™ve got left.

{{<wordlimit>}}

We can define the problem more clearly:

Given an input box,
When I type characters into the input box
Then I should be notified about how many characters Iâ€™ve got left.

### ðŸ§­ Strategy

We can describe a rough strategy as follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Access the input element] --> B[Step 2: get the number of characters left]
B --> C[Step 3: Update the interface with the number of characters left]
```

This strategy gives us a rough guide to the road ahead: it may need to change as we discover more about the environment and the problem we're working on.
