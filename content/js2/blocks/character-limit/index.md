Letâ€™s define a problem.

Suppose we're working on a website where users will need to send messages. They'll provided with an input box where they can type their message. However, there is a _character limit_ of 120. As users type in to the box they should get feedback on how many characters they've got left.

{{<wordlimit>}}

We can define the problem more clearly:

> _Given_ an input box and a character limit of 120,
> _When_ I type characters into the input box
> _Then_ I should be told how many characters Iâ€™ve got left

### ðŸ§­ Strategy

We can outline a strategy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Access the input element] --> B[Step 2: get the number of characters left]
B --> C[Step 3: Update the interface with the number of characters left]
```

This strategy gives us a rough guide for the road ahead. However, as we learn more about this problem, we may need to update our strategy.
