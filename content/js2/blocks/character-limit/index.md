Letâ€™s define a problem.

Suppose we're working on a website where users will need to send messages. They'll provided with an input box where they can type their message. However, there is a _character limit_ of 120. As users type in to the box they should get feedback on how many characters they've got left.

{{<wordlimit>}}

We can define the problem more clearly:

> _Given_ an input box and a character limit of 120,
> _When_ I type characters into the input box
> _Then_ I should be told how many characters Iâ€™ve got left
