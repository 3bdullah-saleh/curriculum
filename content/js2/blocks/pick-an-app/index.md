This week you're building small UI components using DOM manipulation.

## ðŸ§° Setup

1. You'll need to get into groups of no more than three
2. Choose one of the "Build a ..." issues from your [JS2 Week 3 backlog](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js2/sprints/3/backlog/)
   It can be an app that one of you have already started or one that you'd all like to tackle together.
3. Get into groups and have one person share their screen.
4. As a group, you'll have to discuss your strategy and implementation for the acceptance criteria on these issues
