This week you're building small UI components using DOM manipulation.

## ðŸ§° Setup

1. You'll need to get into pairs
2. Choose one of the "Build a ..." issues from your [JS2 Week 3 backlog](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/js2/sprints/3/backlog/)
3. Get into groups and have one person share their screen.
4. As a group, you'll have to discuss your strategy and implementation for the acceptance criteria on these issues
