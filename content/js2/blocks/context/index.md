In our test, we call the method like this `savingsPot.addToPot(10.00)`;

Weâ€™re using . notation to access the property of the savingsPot object. Inside the method `addToPot` we need access to the argumen (amount of money) and a way to refer to the savingsPot itself

## Enter `this`

```js
function addToPot(amount) {
  console.log(amount);

// logs amount to the console
```

```js
function addToPot() {
  console.log(this);
}
```

The this keyword gives us a reference to the object the method was called upon. In other words,
If we declare a function, then add this function to an object and invoke the function on the object using .notation.

The `this` keyword will point to this object.

`this` allows us to refer to the object inside the method.
