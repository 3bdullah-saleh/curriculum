An event is something that occurs in a programming environment, If a user clicks on a button, this is an event. If the user types something into an input box, then each time they press the keyboard , this is an event.

In the case of the input box, there are lots of events occurring.
The inpt boxâ€™s text is changing.
Whenever a keyboard button is released by the user.

Reacting to an event

We can react to an event using an event handler. An event handler is a function that gets called when some event occurs. We attach event handlers to a particular element using the addEventListinder method. Letâ€™s look at an example:

```js
const input = document.querySelector(â€˜inputâ€™);

input.addEventListener(â€˜keyupâ€™,function handlerKeyUp() {
	console.log(â€˜... on key up â€¦â€™);
});
```

addEventListenser takes 2 arguments - a string and also a function. Weâ€™ve seen a similar situation earlier

```js
test("dssss", function () {});
```
