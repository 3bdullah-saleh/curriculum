> ðŸŽ¯ Sub-goal is to compute the sum of an array of numbers.

To sum a list we can initialise a variable with a value of `0`.

We then need to **repeatedly** increment `count` for each item in the `list`.

```js
let total = 0;
const list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

list[0] += total; // access a list element and add to total
list[1] += total;
list[2] += total;
list[3] += total;
list[4] += total;
```

However, this method doesn't work for any array.
If the number of items in `list` changes then we may have to change the number of statements updating the `total`.
