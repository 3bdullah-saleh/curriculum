Let's consider another problem.
Besides the median, we can also calculate the mean of a set of numbers.

We want to calculate the [median](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zwhgk2p/revision/2) value from an array of numbers.

_Given_ an array of numbers,
_When_ we call `calculateMean`
_Then_ we get the mean

Suppose we now need to calculate mean of a list of data. We can calculate the mean of a lsit of data by summing the data and then dividing by the number of items in the list.

```js
expect(calculateMean([3, 40, 7])).toBe(25);
```

So we can implement `calculateMean` - find the middle position of the list and access the middle element, return the middle element.
Let's create a test to check its functionality:

```js
expect(calculateMean([3, 40, 7])).toBe(25);
```

In this test, we're checking we get a value of `25` by adding together `3 + 40 + 7` and then dividing by the number of items (`3`).
