Letâ€™s define a problem.

Weâ€™ll start with an input element as defined by some HTML. Weâ€™ll have a word limit on this input box so that users canâ€™t exceed a certain number of words. As users type in the box, they should get feedback on the number of words theyâ€™ve got left.

<html>
<section>
  <input id="word-limit-input" type="text" />

<label id="word-limit-label" for="input">Words remaining: </label>
<progress id="input" value="32" max="100">32%</progress>

</section>
<script>
    console.log('hello');
    console.log(document.querySelector('input'))
    const input = document.querySelector('#word-limit-input');
    input.addEventListener('keyup',function handleKeyUp() {
        console.log("he")
        document.querySelector('#word-limit-label').innerText = `Words done: ${input.value.split(' ').length}`
    });
    
</script>
</html>
We can define the problem more clearly:

Given an input box,
When I type characters into the input box
Then I should be notified about how many characters Iâ€™ve got left.

### ðŸ§­ Strategy

We can describe a rough strategy as follows:

```mermaid

A[Step 1: Access the input element] --> B[Step 2: Count the number of words in the input string]
B --> C[Step 3: Tell the user how many words they've got left]
```

This strategy is approximate: it may need to change as we discover more about the environment and the problem we're working on. However,
