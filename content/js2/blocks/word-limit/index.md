Letâ€™s define a problem.

Weâ€™ll start with an input element as defined by some HTML. Weâ€™ll have a word limit on this input box so that users canâ€™t exceed a certain number of words. As users type in the box, they should get feedback on the number of words theyâ€™ve got left.

Given an input box,
When I type characters into the input box
Then I should be notified about how many characters Iâ€™ve got left.
This is how we could roughly think of our current approach:

Access the input box
Count the number of characters
Tell the user how many characters theyâ€™ve got left

To solve this problem, weâ€™ll need to access and manipulate the web page.
