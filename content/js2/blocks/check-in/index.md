This week you should have been **building an app in pairs**.
Use this time to check your progress and complete any tasks.

### üîë Key questions

You can use the questions below to reflect on your code quality.

- Which acceptance criteria have you completed for your app?
- Have you deployed your app? Do you have a link to the deployed version that you can share with others?
- Is your code formatted properly?
- Is your code readable? E.g. do you have clear function names, variable names etc.

If you're unsure of any of the questions above, use this time to

- finish off acceptance criteria
- get your app deployed
- check your code formatting and quality
