User interfaces provide the gateway between a user and a complex application.
When navigating the internet, we continually interact with web pages to use a particular application's functionality.

A {{<tooltip title="web browser">}} provides a user interface to interact with web pages.{{</tooltip>}} is capable of fetching and then rendering HTML documents to create a user interface. If a user visits a website and gets a plain HTML document back, we say this content is static. By static, we mean that once the page renders in the browser, it will only change if it is programmed to do so. However, when we interact with the elements on the page, we often expect the page to update.
