Browser

The browser is an application that enables users to fetch and interact with websites. The browser is capable of fetching and then rendering HTML documents to produce web pages in the user interface. If a user visits a website and then gets a plain HTML document back, we say this content is static. By static, we mean that once the page is rendered in the browser the content cannot be updated.
