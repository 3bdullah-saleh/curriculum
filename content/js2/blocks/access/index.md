As with arrays, objects are **mutable**.

Given an object

```js
const profileData = {
  firstName: "mitch",
  lastName: "lloyd",
  age: 32,
};
```

We can access the age property using . notation
console.log(profileData.age);
If we try to access a property that doesnâ€™t exist then we get undefined.

console.log(profileData.address); // logs undefined

In this case, address doesnâ€™t exist on the profileData object so we get undefined.
