We use . dot notation to access values using their key.

Given an object

```js
const profileData = {
  firstName: "mitch",
  lastName: "lloyd",
  age: 32,
};
```

We start by referencing the object `profileData`.

Then we can use `.` notation followed by the key used to look up a value.

```js
console.log(profileData.firstName); // logs undefined
```

In this case, address doesnâ€™t exist on the profileData object so we get undefined.
