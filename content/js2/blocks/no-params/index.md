Let's look at the case where the query string is an empty string.

In this case, we need to think of an output that makes sense. As there are no query parameters, it makes sense to return an empty object.

We can write a test case as follows:

```js
test("given a query string with no query parameters, returns an empty object", function () {
  const input = "";
  const currentOutput = parseQueryString(input);
  const targetOutput = {};

  expect(currentOutput).toBe(targetOutput);
});
```

We can pass this test just by returning an empty object for now. We can define a function `parseQueryString` as follows:

```js
function parseQueryString() {
  return {};
}
```

However, after re-running the tests, we get the following feedback:

### Checking objects

In our test, `parseQueryString` returns a reference to an empty object. So `currentOutput` is assigned this reference. And `targetOutput` is assigned a reference to a **different object**.

If we perform the check with the `toBe` matcher we get a message back from Jest:

```console
If it should pass with deep equality, replace "toBe" with "toStrictEqual"
```

In other words, `toBe` checks **references** of two objects. As `currentOutput`and `targetOutput` point to different objects - this can never be true. However, we can use a different matcher that compares the **contents** of the two objects. We can use [`toStrictEqual`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tostrictequalvalue) to check that both objects have exaclty the same contents.

```js
expect(currentOutput).toStrictEqual(targetOutput);
```
