You'll need to take this time to prepare for next week.

## ðŸ§° Setup

1. You'll need to split up into pairs with someone you've not worked with before.
2. Together in your pairs, you'll need to choose a project from the `mini-dom` section of the Module-JS2 repo. Together you'll need to coordinate how you can meet up during the week to work on this project together. Check your availability.
