The `profileData` object is built up of **properties**.
Each **property** is an association between a key and a value.

```js
{
  firstName: "mitch",
  lastName: "lloyd",
  age: 32,
};
```

In the object above, there are 3 properties.
The first propert consists of `firstName: "mitch"`.

This property forms a **key-value pair**, the string on the left of the `:` is the key `firstName`.
On the right of the `:` is the property value "mitch".
