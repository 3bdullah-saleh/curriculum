`firstName` : ‘mitch’ is an example of a key-value pair.
`firstName` is the key. The key is always a string even if it doesn’t include quotation marks around the key.
`’mitch’’ is the value.
`age: 32` is another example of a key value pair. This time the value is of type number.
So we can store any datatype we like as the value in an object.
