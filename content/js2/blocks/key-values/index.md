    2='Define an object property'

As with the table, the `profileData` object is made up of **properties**.
Each **property** is an association between a key and a value.

```js
{
  firstName: "Francesco",
  lastName: "Leoni",
  age: 33,
};
```

In the {{<tooltip title="object literal">}} An object literal is an object defined by writing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs inside of curly braces.{{</tooltip>}} above, there are 3 properties.
The first property consists of `firstName: "Francesco"`.

This property forms a **key-value pair**, the string on the left of the `:` is the key `firstName`. On the right of the `:` is the property value "Francesco". In objects, each **key-value pair** is separated by a comma.
