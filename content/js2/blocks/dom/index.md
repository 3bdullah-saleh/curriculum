The DOM

We can start by inspecting the DOM - this is the Document Object Model. The DOM is an API.
When the browser renders a page it also generates a representation of the document that enables it to be updated. We can use JavaScript to interact with the DOM. This is what enables us to write programs that update the web page.

Javascript

Recall: JavaScript is a programming language. It is a set of rules for writing instructions that are understood by computers.

Node is a runtime environment: it is an application that runs JavaScript code. Using Node, we can develop applications inside JavaScript. However, Node wasnâ€™t the first runtime environment for JavaScript.
