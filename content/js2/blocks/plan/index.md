We can outline a strategy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Step 1: Define the character limit] --> B[Step 2: Access the input element] --> C[Step 3: calculate the number of characters left] --> D[Step 4: Update the interface with the number of characters left]
```

This strategy gives us a rough guide for the road ahead. However, as we learn more about this problem, we may need to update our strategy.
