Every CYF session begins with an energiser. Usually there's a rota showing who will lead the energiser. We have some CYF favourite games you can play if you are stuck.

1. Traffic Jam : re-order the cars to unblock yourself
2. Telephone: draw the words and write the pictures
3. Popcorn show and tell: popcorn around the room and show one nearby object or something in your pocket or bag and explain what it means to you.
