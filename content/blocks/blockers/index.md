### Gameplay

{{<note type="activity" title=" Exercise 30 minutes">}}
In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!
{{</note>}}

**Each person must drive,** so set a timer for [**5 minutes per round**](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+a+timer+for+5+minutes) and then swap.

### Reflection

Back in the main room.
