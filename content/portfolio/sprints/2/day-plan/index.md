##¬†Retrospective

- Review and remind yourself of the requirements, are you on track towards the MVP?
- Have you managed to get user feedback for a deployed version of your application?
- Are you communicating frequently?
- Are you releasing branches frequently?
- Are you catching bugs?

## Break

## Design 1 - The Interface - what should it look like to your end users, starting building up an idea of the main views,

- devise some basic wireframes, get a shell of the lookout for the application
- what sort of mock data will this view need to be realised?

## Design 2 - Architecture

- What are the key components of the application, how are they connected, is it a static or a dynamic application, what kind of data are you storing?
- What sort of data does the client application need - what kind of data is it fetching?
- What is the purpose of each component in your application, how will it communicate with other components in the architecture?

## Break it down / Prepare backlog

- Create an issue together

In this section you will need to break down the project definition into smaller units of work.
To help you do this, you will need to do the following:
Decide on the type of work you are doing:

Here is one way of doing this:
Choose a user story,

- Break down the elements of the functionality into isolated areas ( typically frontend or backend )
- Work out how the areas are coupled ( connected ) and whether you can work on each unit in isolation. Can you create a separate issue to join up the two different areas once you're happy they're working.
- Create one issue for setting up your
- Decide what kind of areas of work are required for this feature:

- Spike
- Feature
- Fix
- Build
- Refactor
- Style
- Test

- Devise acceptance criteria for each unit of work
- Come up with a complexity estimate for your unit of work

## Next steps

- Comms: how are you going to communicate with each other during the week
- Git workflow: what does your git workflow look like? Are you going to stand up each day for check in asynchronously
- User feedback: how will gain user feedback? How will you turn this feedback into useful insights?

## User feedback

- Analyse feedback on your application as it is so far. Can users make use of any functionality?
- If users cannot interact with your application - then this is also good feedback! How can you get feedback as quickly as possible?
