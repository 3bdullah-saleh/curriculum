    1='Establish the rules for getting a new project off the ground'
+++

We're going to start off by defining rules and expectations for working on projects on the course.

### 📐 Ground rules

1. We go together
2. We are flexible to people's needs
3. "Done" means "Good enough to show an employer"

### 🏗️ Projects

- Do one project at a time
- We start a new project when everyone has finished the current one
- We will put in the time - 25 hours

### Flexibility

- 1 project or 5 - we'll do what people need
- We can work as individuals or in groups
- You need to express your needs

"Done" means "Good enough to show an employer"

1 Great user story is better than 10 meh user stories

### Communication

- Post a link to your deployed application by midnight at the end of every Thursday
- If everyone is ~done, we'll start a new project on Saturday
- If you're not done, LIST YOUR QUESTIONS AND BLOCKERS
- But don't wait until Thursday to get help
