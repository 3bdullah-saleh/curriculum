Now you should have an initial idea of the user interface, modelling the data and user stories for the project.

You'll need to break up the user stories into manageable units of work.
Breaking down tasks into sub-problems is challenging: we often don't know in advance how challenging the sub-problem will be. However through iteration, practice and feedback we can continue improving how we approach breaking things down.

1. Choose one user story
2. Can you break it into smaller user stories that represent each stage of the workflow
3. Come up with acceptance criteria for the user story
4. Label your issue: User Story, Fix, Bug, etc
5. Estimate the time complexity of your issues
