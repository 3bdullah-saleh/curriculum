## 🗺️ Architecture

Thinking about the architecture of the application.

- What are the key components of the application, how are they connected, is it a static or a dynamic application, what kind of data are you storing?
- What sort of data does the client application need - what kind of data is it fetching?
- What is the purpose of each component in your application, how will it communicate with other components in the architecture?
